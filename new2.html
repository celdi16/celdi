        <h2>HI, welcome to shards dev.5.1 in this version
        we have added a rediculus amount of fixes some for bugs
        that have been around since dev.1 which is a stupid long time
        and we have tried to add a few new abilitys to the player
        such as crouching, which may be attempted but as previously stated
        will leave the player imobile when used. This is our priority for
        version dev.5.2 which should be the final update before dev.6 which
        we plan to release if it can be finished within the next few weeks
        it just so happens to be (in my opinion) the best update so far
        but i belive you will have to wait another 2 weeks before crouching
        is fully implimented but we do plan to update the player physics so
        you guys can look forward to that! Finally we did update the map slightly
        we made all maps the same with a grey background (we used this to test the background
        bleeding fix) all we can say now is that we hope you enjoy!
        Also dont forget to join the <a href="sorry2.txt">discord</a>
        rember anyone is welcome!</h2>
