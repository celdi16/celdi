      Hii, im nora (online im known as celdi)
      and im working on a game called shards.
      The theme of the game will remain a mystery until
      a later date but i can assure you that there is one now
      and for anyone who has the skills and patience to data-mine
      the current release they will find many eastereggs and
      non-player reachable rooms. Some may take this as a challange
      and id be happy to see if anyone succeds!
      if you want to ask anything feel free to dm me
      or send a message in my discord server which is linked in <a href="new2.html">news</a>
      HAVE FUN!
    </h1>
